# Knight Moves in Python

In one of my interview questions, i was asked to calculate the total number of moves a knight has, 
provided the initial position of the knight as a coordinate, eg. (3,6)

I was able to complete the question with time to spare and now is the time to share it with my friends!
Such questions are asked mainly to test not just your problem solving skills but also your creativity.
Thankfully, i am an avid chess player and didnt face many challenges while solving this problem

Try solving such problems in your head before interviews. They really help!
